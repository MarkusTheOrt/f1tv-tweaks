# F1TV Tweaks

This extension is developed to counter small annoyances with the F1TV streaming page. It adds keyboard shortcuts to manage media playback and modifies the page layout to increase the size of the player to be as large as possible.

## Shortcuts
The extension provides the following shortcuts to manage the web player:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
|`f`|Toggle fullscreen|
|`space`| Toggle play/pause |
|`m`|Toggle mute|
|`up arrow`|Increase volume|
|`down arrow`|Decrease volume|
|`l`|Lock video controls as visible|
|`d`|Open driver picker control|

## Todo
 - [x] Select camera view from sidebar with shortcut
 - [ ] Configurable key map
 - [x] Different page layout
